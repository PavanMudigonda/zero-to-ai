# Quizzes

These quizzes are the pre- and post-lecture quizzes for the data science curriculum at https://aka.ms/datascience-beginners
## Adding a translated quiz set

Add a quiz translation by creating matching quiz structures in the `assets/translations` folders. The canonical quizzes are in `assets/translations/en`. The quizzes are broken into several groupings. Make sure to align the numbering with the proper quiz section. There are 40 quizzes total in this curriculum, with the count starting at 0.

After editing the translations, edit the index.js file in the translation folder to import all the files following the conventions in `en`.

Edit the `index.js` file in `assets/translations` to import the new translated files.

Then, edit the dropdown in `App.vue` in this app to add your language. Match the localized abbreviation to the folder name for your language.

Finally, edit all the quiz links in the translated lessons, if they exist, to include this localization as a query parameter: `?loc=fr` for example.

## What Comes Next

This folder supports the imported course quizzes rather than the main learning flow:

- Return to the [Microsoft course overview](../README.md) if you are studying the curriculum itself.
- Use this folder only when you need to maintain quiz translations or run the quiz app locally.
- For the learner-facing quiz collection in this repo, see the main [21-quizzes/README.md](../../../../21-quizzes/README.md).
